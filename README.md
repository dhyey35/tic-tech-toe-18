### Project Overview

We have chosen problem statement 3.
We had made webapp in Angular Framework. We have integrated Google Maps API to get location of user. 

We have integrated Google Translator API to translate our website into Indian languages.

**Why to donate? when you can invest?**

Here we are taking financial grants from investor like from MSEs and others and giving them return on their investment by taking token amount on using our labs and computers at nominal rates.
MNCs are also interested by giving us financial grants and doing their CSR's. 

**We have 3 types of users:**

1. Company: Company who are interested in giving financial grant
2. Investor: An individual who is interested in investing money
3. Volunteer: When you are over interested in giving free education to rural people

We are taking requests from different regions of India to develop Computer Labs and Internet Networks in their regionals.

We will calculate the number of people who will use the computer labs in rural areas. We will also provide them instructors to manage lab. Company will be benefited because we are branding their name on our website and individual will get benefited by getting return on investment.

**So this is how we are providing computer labs with internet and with instructor to facilitate education among the rural kids. A small step of ours have made a big difference!!!**
